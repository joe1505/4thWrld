<h1>Why the Covid Numbers are Alarming</h1>
<p>Let me start by saying that I'm not a healthcare professional, first responder,
or even a politician. But I do spend a lot of time working with numbers and trying
to figure out what they are saying. And the Covid-19 numbers scare me. I did some
quick calculations based on what the US has experienced so far. Those calculations
suggest the US could have millions infected and thousands dead in just a few weeks. 
<p> The current numbers are not the scary part.
The current total of 81,783 infected as of March 26 is significant, but not
that big of a number for a country the size of the United States. Even the number
of 1,147 dead is a tragedy for those infected but not very big compared to
deaths from other causes in the US.
<p> What's scary is the trend &mdash; the rate of increase in the numbers. From
March 4 to March 23 the number of infected people went from 111 to 42752; that's
an increase of almost 37% per day or nearly a factor of 9 per week. The death
rate increase is harder to estimate than the infection rate because the numbers are
a lot smaller, but they seem to be following a similar rate of increase.
<p> The rate of increase in the infection rate has been a bit lower the last couple
of days &mdash; in the 20 to 25% range. If those numbers hold, they could be an
indication that the stay-at-home orders and other measures are succeeding in
slowing the spread of the virus.  That's not comforting, but better than 37%.
<p> Here's a quick back-of-the-envelope rough calculation to see what these numbers
might imply for the future. I calculated the infection
and death counts for 17 days out starting from March 24 (which brings us to Easter)
and assuming 10%, 20%, or 30% rate of increase. I chose these numbers because 10%
is in the range that Italy is seeing with a tight lockdown, 20% is around what
the US has seen for a couple of days, and 30% is a bit more optimistic than
the long-term US experience of 37%.
<p> So, starting from 81,783 and 1,147 on March 26, then on Easter (April 12) we would
have:
<br>10% daily increase gives 413370 infected and 5797 dead
<br>20% daily increase gives 1814447 infected and 25447 dead
<br>30% daily increase gives 13438076 infected and 188468 dead
<h2>Are these estimates real, and why so big?</h2>
<p> The estimates depend on a lot of assumptions.  I include links to the source data
and calculations below, so others can evaulate how realistic my assumptions are.
<p> A number that increases by a fixed percentage every day is what mathematicians
call "exponential increase." As you can see in the diagram at the top of this page
(from Wikipedia), exponential increase starts out deceptively slowly, but then grows
rapidly. Viruses and other infections are a classic example of things that tend to
grow exponentially until they run out of new hosts to infect.
<p> So when does exponential growth slow down? I don't know, but there are several
possibilities:
<ul>
  <li>A vaccine or some other treatment stops the spread to new patients;</li> 
  <li>We minimize opportunities for the virus to spread (isolation, protection,
      disinfection);</li>
  <li>Most of those who can be infected in a particular area are already infected.</li>
</ul>
